#### READme.md

Include the overall steps and tools used in this assignment. 

#### Dockerfile

```bash

FROM public.ecr.aws/bitnami/node:latest

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./


RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
  ```

### ecs-task-dfinition.json
```bash

FROM public.ecr.aws/bitnami/node:latest

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./


RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```
### server.js
```bash

FROM public.ecr.aws/bitnami/node:latest

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./


RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

### .github/workflows/aws.yml
```bash
# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when a release is created
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region ap-southeast-1`.
#    Replace the value of `ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Replace the value of `aws-region` in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
#      https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=ap-southeast-1#/firstRun
#    Replace the values for `service` and `cluster` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.
#
# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
#    Replace the value of `task-definition` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name.
#    Replace the value of `container-name` in the workflow below with the name of the container
#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
#
# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

### Command and Steps to Run in Visual Studio Code under terminal
- Git clone <repository ssh>
- Npm init 
- Npm install serverless - package.json will appear
- Create server.js
- Npm install serverless-offline- package-lock.json will appear
- Move the node_module into .gitignore
- Create Dockerfile.
- Create ECS and ECR in Aws console.
- Create task definition in Aws console under ECR and include the task name into the tak-definition.json
- Create cluter under ECS and include the cluster name into aws.yml file. 
- Create aws.yml under file .github/workflows, input login to ECR, create docker image and push into ECS inside the aws.yml.
- Carry out Github Action and Run the workflow.
